    <h1 class="glow">To the One I Love</h1>
    <p style="--i:1">I know there must be lakhs of people like me who send messages to people like you.
But I only have you with me.</p>
<p style="--i:2">I know that if you want, you can choose not to talk to someone like me — and it probably won’t make any difference to you.</p>
<p style="--i:3">But if you ever have a night where you can’t sleep… ask me how it feels, because I stay awake every night thinking about you 🌙💭.</p>
<p style="--i:4">I'm sorry to say this, but maybe you don’t have any feelings for me.
Still, I have unlimited feelings for you — endless, unshakable, eternal 💞♾️.</p>
<p style="--i:5">The moon may stop rising… the sun may stop shining…
But my love for you will never fade, not even for a second ☀️🌕❤️.</p>
<p style="--i:6">Maybe you think I talk big, but trust me — my feelings are even bigger than my words.
I love you a thousand times more than I could ever express 💖.</p>
<p style="--i:7">I don’t know what your past holds…
But I promise, your future will be beautiful — and I’m not saying this just to say it.
If needed, I can write all of this for you — even on stamp paper — because that’s how serious I am 📝🖋️.</p>
<p style="--i:8">Please try to understand me:
If you’re with me, everything feels right ✨.
If you’re not… everything feels meaningless 😔.</p>
<p style="--i:9">When you're around, I feel alive 😊.
Without you, I lose interest in everything 🥀.</p>
<p style="--i:10">Not everything can be explained in a single message,
but I know you'll try to understand.
And I promise you — you’ll never be hurt by my heart 💓🙏.</p>
<p style="--i:11">I know I still have to prove a lot to you…
But what I do know is: you matter to me more than anything else in the world 🌍❤️.</p>
<p style="--i:12">People often have a reason for liking someone.
But I don’t have a specific reason — I just feel it deeply… without explanation 🌌.</p>
<p style="--i:13">There’s one thing I want to say — I have liked you since the day I first met you 🌸.
I just didn’t have the courage to say it earlier.
Now that I’ve got this chance, I don’t want to let you go 🤝.</p>
<p style="--i:14">I can wait a lifetime for you ⏳.
But I could never wait for someone else the way I wait for you 💘.</p>
<p style="--i:15">I wish I had been your first love…
I wish I could be the one who never breaks your heart…
And I wish — from the bottom of my heart — that one day, you feel the same for me ❤️‍🔥.</p>
<p style="--i:16">I know I may not be your first love,
But believe me — I will love you so deeply,
That neither you’ve felt a love like this before,
Nor will you ever feel it again ❣️.</p>
    <div class="footer glow">Even in silence, my heart speaks only your name.</div>
